# Fin-StatisticalArbitrage

The financial model is a implementation of techniques shown in the fantastic paper 'Machine Learning in Asset Management' by Derek Snow.

Time series modelling using GMM (Gaussian Mixture Modelling) and Expectation Maximization.

#Problem Statement : 

Understanding the behaviour of 2 returns over a period of time and correlation between the two. Clustering the similar returns. The concept of pair trading has been implemented in the code and Expectancy of the pairs to converge will give the better assessment for investing at the right time.   

The unsupervised method to understand the historical prices and calculating the returns based on the past behaviour comes under 'Priced based trading strategy'

As part of improvement this implementations will also be focusing on the supervised approach to the GMM clustering add solution around the same
